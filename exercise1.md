The language I chose was Python. I mainly chose it because I have most experience with it. One good linting tool that I have used is Pylint. Pytest is pythons built-in testing framework and it works quite well. Python is interpreted and not built. However, I could use Poetry for packaging.

One alternate to GitHub Actions and Jenkins that I found is CircleCI. It's a cloud-based CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions. Another alternate would be Gitlab CI/CD. It is a DevOps platform that integrates version control, CI/CD and monitoring. From big companies there are also couple of good choices: Azure DevOps and AWS CodePipeline. They would be ideal for their respective pipelines, so Azure would be ideal if you were already working in Microsoft ecosystem and AWS if you were invested in Amazon Web Services infrastructure.

I feel like this setup would be better in a cloud-based environment, because Python CI pipelines are mostly light, so heavy compilation is not needed. I wouldn't use said setup for too big projects either, so cloud-based environment would be the best option. However, if I was working with bigger project and had a lot of resources and time, self hosted would be ideal.
